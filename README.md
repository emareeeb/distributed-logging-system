### Note on File Upload Restrictions

Due to GitHub's **file size limits** (Global: 25MB soft limit, 50MB hard limit; Local: 100MB), we were unable to upload the compressed versions of the required tools: **Kafka**, **Kibana**, and **Elasticsearch**. A screenshot demonstrating this limitation has been provided for reference. 

To ensure smooth progress and accessibility for Week 3 deliverables, we have hosted the necessary installation files on a secure Google Drive link. 

You can access the required files here:

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. Thank you! ðŸ˜Š
